### Biography
 
| <br>**Zhiyuan Zha (查志远）** is a postdoctoral research fellow at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, working with [Prof. Bihan Wen](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/bihan.wen/). Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, working with [Prof. Ce Zhu](http://www.avc2-lab.net/~eczhu/). I received a Ph.D. degree from the School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2018. My research interests include inverse problems in image and volume data (e.g., video, Hyperspectral image and medical image) processing, sparse signal representation, and machine learning. <br> <br> **Email：** <zhazhiyuan.mmd@gmail.com>, <zhiyuan.zha@ntu.edu.sg>. <br><br>|  ![image](https://zhazhiyuan.github.io/images/IMG_2698.JPG)|
